Capstone Project - KUKA youbot - Mobie Manipulator

A software is written to simulate an autonomous completion of a mobile manipulation task using KUKA youBot mobile manipulator

The software does the following,
  Generates end effector trajectory based on the initial and final configurations of the object to be manipulated.
  Generates CSV files containing the joint values, chassis configuration, wheel angles using forward kinematics.
  Uses a feedforward-PI controller to achieve the desired robot configuration.
  
The videos of simulation have also been added in the repo folder.
